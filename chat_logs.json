Choose a format and stick to it.\n   - Consider using a Python docstring style like Google, NumPy, or reStructuredText to document functions, classes, and modules.\n\n3. **Comment Regularly**:\n   - Add comments frequently to provide context and clarification, especially in areas that might be confusing to others (and your future self).\n   - Comments should accompany changes or updates to the code to keep them relevant.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundant Comments**:\n   - Don't write comments that just restate the code. Comments should add value by explaining the why or rationale behind the code.\n\n5. **Update Comments Consistently**:\n   - Maintain and update comments as the code evolves. Outdated or incorrect comments can be misleading and reduce the code's maintainability.\n\n6. **Use Inline Comments Sparingly**:\n   - Use inline comments for short explanations or clarifications within the code. Avoid excessive inline comments that clutter the code.\n\n7. **Document Functionality, Not Implementation**:\n   - Focus on documenting the functionality and behavior of the code rather than the implementation details. Keep comments at the right level of abstraction.\n\n8. **Write Self-Explanatory Code**:\n   - Write code that is self-explanatory and clear. Comments should supplement the code, not replace good coding practices.\n\n9. **Consider Code Readability**:\n   - Comments should improve code readability. Break down complex logic into smaller, understandable parts with accompanying comments.\n\n10. **Address Future Considerations**:\n    - Anticipate potential pitfalls or considerations in the code and document them in comments. Provide information on trade-offs or performance implications.\n\n11. **Use Comments for TODOs and FIXMEs**:\n    - Use comments to mark TODOs (tasks to be done) and FIXMEs (known issues) in the code.

Here are examples of how you can generate informative comments and docstrings for the functions and logic blocks in your Python calculator code:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(x, y):\n    \"\"\"\n    Add two numbers and return the result.\n\n    Parameters:\n    x (int or float): The first number to be added.\n    y (int or float): The second number to be added.\n\n    Returns:\n    int or float: The sum of x and y.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Perform addition\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract_numbers(x, y):\n    \"\"\"\n    Subtract one number from another and return the result.\n\n    Parameters:\n    x (int or float): The number to be subtracted from.\n    y (int or float): The number to subtract.\n\n    Returns:\n    int or float: The result of subtracting y from x.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Perform subtraction\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply_numbers(x, y):\n    \"\"\"\n    Multiply two numbers and return the product.\n\n    Parameters:\n    x (int or float): The first number to be multiplied.\n    y (int or float): The second number to be multiplied.\n\n    Returns:\n    int or float: The product of x and y.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Perform multiplication\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide_numbers(x, y):\n    \"\"\"\n    Divide one number by another and return the result.\n\n    Parameters:\n    x (int or float): The dividend.\n    y (int or float): The divisor.\n\n    Returns:\n    float or str: The result of dividing x by y. Returns an error message for division by zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    if y == 0:\n        return \"Error! Division by zero.\"\n    \n    # Perform division\n    return x / y\n\n# Main function that handles user input and arithmetic operations\ndef calculator():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main calculator function that prompts the user to choose an operation and performs the calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # User input and operation selection logic here...\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculator()\n```\n\nIn these examples, each function is accompanied by a descriptive docstring that explains the purpose of the function, its parameters, and return values. Additionally, comments within the functions clarify the logic of each operation. Ensure to adapt these comments and docstrings to suit the specific requirements and details of your Python calculator code.","statusCode":200}]
